# MapViewer-Web: Visualizing galaxy properties from the GIST pipeline products

[![LICENSE](https://img.shields.io/badge/lisence-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/purmortal/mapviewer-web/blob/master/LICENSE)

Mapviewer-web is a web-based tool for visualizing galaxy properties analyzed by the [GIST Pipeline](https://gitlab.com/abittner/gist-development).
It is an enhanced adaptation of the original PyQt-based [Mapviewer](https://gitlab.com/abittner/gist-development/-/blob/master/gistPipeline/Mapviewer.py?ref_type=heads) widget, 
offering improved interactivity and easier access through web browsers. 
This web version also significantly reduces response times compared to its desktop counterpart.

```
pip install mapviewer-web
```
